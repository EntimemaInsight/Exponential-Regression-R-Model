# Exponential Regression Model for Revenue Growth
This project uses an exponential regression model to analyze the relationship between Previous Spending (independent variable) and Revenue Growth (dependent variable) for a specific data set.

## Background
Based on an initial analysis of the data, it appears that the relationship between Previous Spending and Revenue Growth is non-linear. Therefore, an exponential regression model was chosen as a potential model for the data.

## Model Description
The exponential regression model assumes that the relationship between Revenue Growth and Previous Spending is of the form:

\begin{equation}
\text{y} = a \cdot e^{b \cdot \text{x}}
\end{equation}
